# ChennaiPrice-Pro
---

House Price Prediction App is a machine learning-based web application designed to provide accurate price predictions for properties in Chennai, India. This project leverages exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced machine learning models, such as XGBoost, to estimate house prices based on key property features.

Features:
- Interactive Data Visualizations: Explore trends and insights derived from the dataset through dynamic visualizations integrated into the app.
  
- Real-time Price Prediction: Input property details such as location, number of rooms, area, age, and other features to get instant price estimates.
  
- Advanced Machine Learning: Powered by the XGBoost regressor, the app ensures high accuracy and reliability in predictions.
  
- Streamlit Interface: A sleek and user-friendly web interface, accessible through any browser.
  
- Customizable: Easily adaptable for similar use cases in different cities or regions.
  
Technical Highlights:
- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical data encoding to prepare a clean dataset.
  
- Model Training: Implemented and fine-tuned XGBoost regressor for optimal performance.

- Web Deployment: Built using Streamlit, with features for data visualization, prediction, and user interaction.

- Error Metrics: Evaluated the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-Squared (RÂ²) to ensure robustness.

Goals:
This project aims to simplify the decision-making process for real estate buyers, sellers, and agents by providing data-driven price estimates. The app also serves as a demonstration of effective data science practices and machine learning deployment.
